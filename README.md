# FPSProject

Using Unreal Engine for a project was a definite goal of mine. I also wanted to learn more about C++ and so these two melded perfectly for this project: creating an FPS in unreal.

The C++ written is a basic controller for my FPS, which is really just an FP because I have no shooting component to the game. I wanted to get camera movement using mouse input working as well as movement using WASD keys and jumping with the spacebar.
